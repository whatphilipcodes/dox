import Component from '../../components/custom/Component.tsx';

In any place where you can use Markdown in this template, you can also use MDX instead. The according [integration](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/) is installed and configured by default. Both the `.md` as well as the `.mdx` file extensions are valid in your `./src/content` directory.

### What does MDX do?

MDX allows you to use variables, JSX expressions and components within your Markdown content. For the latter, this template includes a directory for custom components:

```js
./src/components/custom
```

> The content of this folder is not synced when the `template-sync` action is run. If you install additional dependencies however, you will have to cherry pick from the syncronization PR.

Here is how you add a custom component in Markdown:

```mdx

---

{/* add the import statement after your frontmatter */}
import Component from '../../components/custom/Component.tsx';

{/* use the component like you would somewhere else in Astro */}

<Component client:load alertMessage='Hello from React!' />
```

This will render to:

<Component client:load alertMessage='Hello from React!' />

> Keep in mind that in Astro you need to include [client directives](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/#client-directives) if you are using UI frameworks like React in your components.
