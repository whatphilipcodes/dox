# Theory & Research

- **Haas Effect (Precedence Effect)**
  - The brain perceives sound from two sources as coming from a single location if the second sound arrives within 30-50 milliseconds after the first
  - This is frequently applied when using any effects like `delay`or `reverb`that shift the signal timing around a strong dry signal to simulate different environments around the input
- **Binaural Beats**
  - Perceived sound phenomenon when two slightly different frequencies are played in each ear, creating a pulsation (beat-like) impression
  - The effect can be replicated using sine waves below `1500 Hz` in each ear that are tuned with a slight difference in frequency below `30 Hz`.
    - on Wikipedia there is an example:

- **Missing Fundamental (Virtual Pitch)**
  - Perception of a pitch even when the lowest fundamental frequency is absent
  - Especially helpful when dealing with low-end in order to make space in the mix available while maintaining the impression of bass
- **Fletcher-Munson Curve (Equal-Loudness Contour)**
  - Human hearing sensitivity varies at different frequencies and volume levels. This variance is visualized in a series of curves that correspond to different pressure levels
  - Being aware of these non-linearities helps when mixing signals at distinct frequency domains (eg. a hihat at around `10 kHz` will be perceived to be louder at the same level as a hihat at around `5 kHz`)
- **Cocktail Party Effect**
  - Human ability to focus on a single audio source in a noisy environment
    - also known as selective or intelligent hearing
  - As this effect is more prone to the listening experience it can apply to all productions that incorporate multiple tracks of differing audio sources. When concentrating on a violin in the wall of sound generated by an orchestra one might be able to hear the individual notes that the instrument produces
- **Shepard Tone**
  - Illusion of a continuously ascending or descending tone without ever actually changing pitch over longer periods of time
  - Created by layering 3 layers of the same signal pitched to neighboring octaves, then continously ascending or descending the pitch of all tracks to the next octave while fading out the lower (→ ascending) or upper (→ descending) signal and fading in the opposite, keeping the middle signal at the same volume the whole time
  - Notably used in movie scoring to create long lasting tension ([Dunkirk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVWTQcZbLgY) → Hans Zimmer)

# Code Example

```python path="shepard_tone.py"
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Shepard Tone
def shepard_tone(f0=440, n_octaves=3, n_samples=44100, duration=5):
    t = np.linspace(0, duration, n_samples)
    f = f0 * 2 ** np.linspace(0, n_octaves, n_samples)
    signal = np.sin(2 * np.pi * np.cumsum(f) * t / n_samples)
    return signal
```
