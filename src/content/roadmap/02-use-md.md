All of the Markdown syntax is available here as well and should work as expected[^1]. You could for example write your to dos:

```markdown
- [ ] to dos in markdown look like this
- [x] when they are done you can put an `x` inside
```

Once you have some things done, this could look like this:

- [x] Learn Markdown
- Implement Astro Integrations
  - [x] MDX
  - [x] React
  - [x] Expressive Code

[^1]: You can even use footnotes
